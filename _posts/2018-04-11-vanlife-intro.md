Last year I finally pulled the trigger on what was a dream of mine for many years. Following a festival that left me questioning how I should spend my free time and energy on, I decided to embark on the adventure of buying a large cargo van and converting it into a vehicle I can take to festivals and occasionally (and maybe at some point full time) live in.

After much research I have decided that I would like to get a 158" Dodge Sprinter, either 2005 or 2006. The reason for this was that this was pretty much the only vehicle within my budget that I can stand in. It's possible I could've afforded a newer Sprinter, but they are considered very [unreliable](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fatal-flaw-mercedes-benz-sprinters-tom-robertson) that that scared me. Once I knew what I was looking for, I spent about two weeks refreshing Craigslist any moment I was awake, until I landed on an ad from a guy named Tim who owns a business called [Sprinter Pit Stop](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sprinter-pitstop-san-diego-2) in San Diego. He a 2005 Sprinter with 257,000 miles for a bit less than $10,000. After a bunch of email exchanges (he was super helpful, answered all my questions, sent pictures, etc.) I decided it's time to go see it in person and booked a flight. I met him the next day with a friend of mine who knows a thing or fifty about vehicles, and we took it for a drive. My friend did the mechanical inspection and nothing major came up. After sleeping on it for a night (especially because it does not have an AC which was hard to swallow) I decided to go for it. Some price negotiation took place, and I was the proud owner of this ex-FedEx delivery vehicle which I then drove to San Francisco.

On the way to San Francisco the CEL (Check Engine Light) turned on - not fun. I immediately ordered a cheap [Bluetooth OBD2 scanner](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XD2LBH3/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which gave me an error code indicating an issue with the Camshaft Sensor. It's a sensor that is only used when starting the engine, and so far I haven't bothered replacing it even though I've had the replacement part from the first week of owning the vehicle. I'll get to it at some point... Other than this annoyance I also had at some point an oil leak from the line feeding oil to the turbocharger, as well as some knocking sound I couldn't identify and turned out to be worn out bushings on a stabilizing bar. Knock on wood, this beast drives pretty well for a vehicle with almost 260,000 miles!

Now that I had a vehicle, it was time to decide what I wanted to do with it. Here's a summary of the work I have done so far:
* Remove the heavy shelves that came with it. No use for that.
* Clean twelve years of dirt (fun!).
* Deal with a bunch of minor issues (some rust, dead windshield washer pump, add 12V cigarette light socket in the front, add some lights in the front)
* Sound dampening - I installed about 70 sqft of [Noico 80 mil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00URUIKAK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) sound dampening material. The difference was very noticeable, which was nice given that it was a pretty labor intensive task!
* Insulate - this was the first major project. I decided to go with a mix of [Rmax Thermasheath-3 1"](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Thermasheath-Rmax-Thermasheath-3-1-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-R-6-Polyisocyanurate-Rigid-Foam-Insulation-Board-787264/100549260) and [3M Thinsulate SM600L](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-Thinsulate-Acoustic-Insulation-SM600L/?N=5002385+3292659035&rt=rud). Van insulation is a topic that is debated to no end on the internet, and everyone has an opinion. I chose these materials because they are very popular, non-toxic, relatively easy to work with, moisture resistant and available. Lots of advantage, but they're not cheap. I think I spent close to $1,000 on this stuff. Wherever I had room I used both - RMax sheet attached to the wall using Great Stuff foam spray insulation, on top of which I glued the Thinsulate using 3M 90 adhesive spray. It works pretty well! I have since used the van in at [Pagan Bunny Burn](http://www.paganbunnyburn.com/) where the temperature neared freezing, and while it was cold (as I have no heat source yet), it was still tolerable. On "hot" SF days the van is warm, but at no point did it get unbearably hot. I also installed a [1" XPS sheet](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Owens-Corning-FOAMULAR-150-1-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-R-5-Scored-Square-Edge-Insulating-Sheathing-20WE/207179253?) under the factory floor, which I decided to keep. I don't know what Mercedes used for it, but for it's thickness (it's pretty thin, ~5/8") it is extremely durable.
* Roof vent - Like every good vehicle dweller, I installed a fan. I chose the [Maxxair Maxxfan Deluxe 7500K](http://www.airxcel.com/maxxair/products/fans/maxxfan-deluxe). I went with the smoke top since apparently it lets some amount of light in, unlike the white top. Since the van has no windows in the rear, I figured some light would be nice.
* Solar panels - I currently have four [Renogy 100W](https://www.renogy.com/renogy-100-watt-12-volt-monocrystalline-solar-panel/) panels on my roof. I attached them using a roof rack I made out of [Unistrut channel](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Superstrut-1-5-8-in-x-1-5-8-in-Gold-Galvanized-Half-Slot-Channel-Strut/1000182121) and some L-brackets. On a few very sunny days I managed to actually generate 400W, which was exciting.
* Battery - I found 8 almost brand new [CALB 100Ah](http://www.calbusainc.com/calb-ca-series/) LiFePo4 cells for a good price on Criagslist, and jumped on the opportunity. I have them configured as one pack in series. I opted for a 24V setup instead of the standard 12V for a few reasons:
    * I liked the idea of cutting down currents by half, especially for the heavy consumers (fridge, inverter).
    * The solar charger/BMS I want to use ([ElectroDacus SBMS40](http://electrodacus.com/)) does not have a DC/DC converter and requires the pack voltage to match the solar panels configuration. If I were to go with a 12V pack, I would have to connect all solar panels in parallel, which would require thicker cables.
    * Not connecting cells in parallel would let me monitor each cell independently.
* Solar charge controller/BMS - It turns out no-one makes one that is suitable for a custom LiFePo4 except the ElectroDacus, which at the time of writing this has not shipped yet. Currently I am using the [EPSolar MPPT 30A](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZV3I6OI/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) controller with a custom and conservative profile. It's still quiet dangerous, and I can't wait to have a proper BMS. I am also awaiting shipment of a [12S Battery Monitoring Board](http://four-forty.com/product/12s-battery-monitoring-board/) which should provide a good solution in the meanwhile.
* Fridge - I like having fridge space, so I went with a relatively large one. The [TruckFridge TF130](http://truckfridge.com/tf130/) has served me well so far. It's pretty quiet, and has a ton of space for my needs.
* Ceiling (and later walls) - I wanted to go with some sort of bright wood. Amazon provided me with these beautiful [Pine Planking](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5LJT11/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). For lights, I went with [acegoo RV Boat Recessed Ceiling Light](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012ZOI44C/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) dimmed by my [custom LED dimmer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-04-10-dual-zone-wireless-led-dimmer.md %}).

* TODO water system (aquatainer, 24v pump, sink, faucet)
* TODO Bed (unistrut, foldable mattress)
* TODO RPi/internet setup
* TODO whats next - heater, more cabinets, walls, inverter + microwave
